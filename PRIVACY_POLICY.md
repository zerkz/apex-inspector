# Apex Inspector Privacy Policy

- Effective Date: July 17th, 2025

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of the Apex Inspector Chrome Extension.

## Information Collection

Apex Inspector does not persist any personal information from users. As this is an extension that displays debugging information about network calls to Salesforce, the extension has to monitor network calls, although it will only process those sent to the `/aura` endpoint.
All of this data deleted/wiped on close of Chrome Devtools, none of it is persisted in local storage or sent anywhere externally. Since no data is collected, none of your data is sold to third parties. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using Apex Inspector, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using Apex Inspector.

## Feedback
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me by [email](mailto:zack.whipkey@gmail.com).
